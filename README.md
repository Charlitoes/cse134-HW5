# cse134-HW5

I removed the duplicate contact me page and only kept the non js version since I liked how the text boxes were.
I also removed some irrelevant files such as a placeholder file I completely forgot about from hw 1 or 2.  
Lastly, made some tweeks to the css so content is easier to read/see on smaller devices and added more 
visiblity to some things that were not visible.
